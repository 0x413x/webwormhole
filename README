CPACE-MACHINE

Cpace Machine creates secure ephemeral pipes between computers.

On one computer:

	$ cpace-machine <file.zip
	8 enlist decadence
	$ shasum file.zip
	71f2727ffa77002b8e48de6555c6ea810950c1c0  file.zip

On another:

	$ cpace-machine 8 enlist decadence >file.zip
	$ shasum file.zip
	71f2727ffa77002b8e48de6555c6ea810950c1c0  file.zip

It is inspired by and uses a model very similar to that of Magic
Wormhole. Thanks Brian Warner!

Cpace Machine differs from Magic Wormhole in that it uses WebRTC
to make the direct peer connections. This allows us to make use of
WebRTC's NAT traversal tricks, as well as the fact that it can be
used in browsers. The exchange of session descriptions (offers and
answers) is protected by PAKE and a generated random password,
similar to Magic Wormhole. The session descriptions include the
fingerprints of the DTLS certificates that WebRTC uses to secure
its communications.

To install:

	$ go get -u github.com/saljam/cpace-machine
