Cpace Machine creates secure ephemeral pipes between computers.

It is inspired by and uses a model very similar to that of Magic
Wormhole. (Thanks Brian Warner!)

Cpace Machine differs from Magic Wormhole in that it uses WebRTC
to make the direct peer connections. The exchange of WebRTC session
descriptions (offers and answers) is protected by PAKE and a generated
random password, but DTLS takes care of securing the direct channel
once both ends have the WebRTC session descriptions.
